Software design and development

What are the first steps in order to solve our problems?

The first stage is a recognition of the problem to be solved.
In a corporate setting, this determination could come from market research.

The second stage is a study of whether the project is feasible.
Ex: Do the development tools exist to produce the software?

The third stage a document is typically produced that specifies precisely what the software should do.

In the fourth stage, a thorough analysis is done before any effort or resources are spent designing and implementing the project.

The fifth stage is the design.
Once a decision has been made to proceed, the software design team works from the requirements document to design the software. 

After the design, the sixth stage would be implementing the application.
The implementation consists of programmers coding the design to produce the software.

The testing team attempts to ensure that the resulting software satisfies the requirements document. 
Failure at this point may require a redesign or even some fine-tuning of the requirements.
